## Notes

We will reserve two tables for 16 people total.
Aeronaut has a $160 bar minimum for the party, so please plan accordingly.
This has to all be put on one card, which I can do and have people Venmo me.\

If there is a line at the door, please proceed directly to the security podium as you arrive between 6:30 and 9:30 pm.\

There is [Venezuelan food on site](https://www.aeronautbrewing.com/visit/somerville/#:~:text=partners%20and%20friends.-,Carolicious,-is%20the%20result), but you can also bring your own food.
