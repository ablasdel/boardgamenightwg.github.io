## What to expect?
Board game nights are a casual, social event directed towards roboticists and 
their friends and family. It's an opportunity to meet other roboticists,
network, and play board games.
The events are typically hosted at a robotics company or 
other social space. Depending on the venue and interest, food and drinks may be
provided. The events are typically held in the evening and last for a few hours.

## What games?
Typically, a range of board games are available ranging from relatively easy games to learn and play to more
challenging games which might require a few hours.

An example of a short game might be [Codenames](https://czechgames.com/en/codenames/)

Games such as chess or poker do not typically feature at board game nights,
but are not explicitly excluded and have occasionally featured.

## What to bring?
Games that follow the theme of the event are always welcome. Usually hosts
bring a selection of games, but it's always nice to have more options.
If you have anything else you'd like to show off such as a hobby robot project
feel free to bring it along, though it's not expected.

## Who to invite?
Anyone who might be interested in playing board games with roboticists or
robotics enthusiasts. The events are open to friends and family, but are
not intended for the general public.

## Age restrictions?
Our board game nights are generally inclusive and do not have a strict age limit.
However, the suitability for minors can depend on the specific venue.
For instance, events held at bars may not permit attendees under the legal drinking age.
This is the exception though, rather than the rule.
We often see a diverse age group among our attendees, from middle schoolers to working professionals.
Our events are usually hosted in environments conducive to all ages,
such as robotics companies, where it's not uncommon for our colleagues to bring their children.
One of our regulars has been participating 
since her high school years and has now transitioned into a professional role in the robotics field.
We value this diversity and the unique perspectives it brings to our community.

## How to host an event?

It is common for the host to provide food and drinks, but is up to the host.
